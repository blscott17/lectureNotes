        <p>
          I worked as a gas station attendant when I was 18. My uniform was
          short shorts and a t-shirt!

      <h3 class="truthLie">Library Card Catalog</h3>
      <p>
        I designed, wrote, tested and implemented the coding application that
        put all of the libraries in the Southwest Michigan Library Consortium
        on-line, generating $60,000 in income for Western Micigan University in
        the process!
